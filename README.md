# AdventOfCode
This is the code I created as solutions to the Advent Of Code challenges.

Each year has its own directory that you can view which also has further directories for each day. The goal was to 
self-study C++ had I saw Advent Of Code not only as a tool for doing so, but also as a broader method for 
furthering my professional development in the industry.

Each day has a makefile with the commands "compile", "run", "partOne", "partTwo", and "clean". "compile" and 
"clean" do as you would expect; creating an executable and removing files respectively. "run" runs both parts of 
the challenge whereas "partOne" and "partTwo" only run their respective parts.

You might notice that these don't contain any input files. This is dilberate as to post my puzzle input would 
violate the terms of Advent of Code.
